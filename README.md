# TensorFlow in Practice workbooks and assignments
## Introduction
These are the notebooks from the [TensorFLow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) Coursera course. This course is an in depth dive into TensorFLow 2.0 (released September 2019)
to create AI applications. I am taking this course in preperation for taking the [TensorFLow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate).

## Why am I doing this?
The frst reason is fun, I want to give myself a challenge to work towards and this is part of my journey to become TensorFlow Developer Certified. 
Historically I have used TensorFlow 1.0 for a lot of projects, but I always found it a little clunky, which meant I seemed to naturally gravitate to using PyTorch more.

While PyTorch is very popular in academia, TensorFLow is still more popular for production jobs in industry (see Figure 1). My aim is to ensure I have knowledge to use either TensorFLow 2.0 or PyTorch my production data science work.
