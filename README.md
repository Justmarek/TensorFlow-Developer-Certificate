# TensorFlow Certification
## Introduction
This repository includes all the work I did locally in preperation for taking the [TensorFLow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate). This includes work and assignments from the following:
- [TensorFlow Developer Handbook](https://www.tensorflow.org/site-assets/downloads/marketing/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf)
- [TensorFlow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)
- [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646)

## Why am I doing this?
The frst reason is fun, I want to give myself a challenge to work towards and this is part of my journey to become TensorFlow Developer Certified. Historically I have used TensorFlow 1.0 for a lot of projects, but I always found it a little bit clunky and intuative, which meant I seemed to naturally gravitate to using PyTorch more. But with the recent release of TenserFlow 2.0 in September 2019, I felt like I should do a deep dive into TensorFlow again. While PyTorch is very popular in academia, TensorFLow is still more popular for production jobs in industry (see Figure 1). My aim is to ensure I have knowledge to use either TensorFLow 2.0 or PyTorch for my production data science work.
