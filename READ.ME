# TensorFlow in Practice workbooks and assignments
## Introduction
These are the notebooks from the [TensorFLow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) Coursera course. This course is an in depth dive into TensorFLow 2.0 (released September 2019)
to create AI applications. I am taking this course in preperation for taking the [TensorFLow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate).

## Why am I doing this?
The frst reason is fun, I want to give myself a challenge to work towards and this is part of my journey to become TensorFlow Developer Certified. 
Historically I have used TensorFlow 1.0 for a lot of projects, but I always found it a little clunky, which meant I seemed to naturally gravitate to using PyTorch more.

While PyTorch is very popular in academia, TensorFLow is still more popular for production jobs in industry:

My aim is to ensure I have the updated knowledge to use TensorFLow 2.0 in my production data science work.
