# Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.
# Prepare text to use in TensorFlow models.
# Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using binary categorization
# Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using multi-class categorization
# Use word embeddings in your TensorFlow model.
# Use LSTMs in your model to classify text for either binary or multi-class categorization.
# Add RNN and GRU layers to your model.
# Use RNNS, LSTMs, GRUs and CNNs in models that work with text.
# Train LSTMs on existing text to generate text (such as songs and poetry)
